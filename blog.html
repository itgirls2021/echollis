     <h2>My Thoughts on Cryptology</h2>
     <p>Emma Hollis / July 23rd, 2021</p>
     <p> 
        Cryptography is the foundation for encryption, which is how we protect all of our personal information online. Things like banking information and certain emails are protected because of encryption. Cryptography is something I would consider to have a positive impact on the world because it protects important personal information, and has helped us historically with security of secret messages. With the ability to encrypt and decrypt certain things are only furthering our national security. One example of a positive way cryptography has impacted us was during World War II cryptologists would decipher secret messages that gave away important information which led to our success during the war.
