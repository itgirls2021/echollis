     <h1>Emma Hollis' Biography</h1>
     <p> 
        Emma Hollis was born in Shreveport, Louisiana on November 3, 2003. 
        After a year of living in Lousiana, Emma and her family moved to Ohio, where they remained for two years before moving to Maryland, where she still resides to this day.
        Emma has one sibling, and older sister named Audrey, who just graduated from the Naval Academy and will fly with the Marines. 
        Emma has two loving, supporting parents; her dad, who is a retired AirForce pilot, and her mom, who works in the school system.
        She also has a dog named Biscuit, who is her pride and joy, and is turning 10 on August 9th.

        Emma is currently a senior attending Mt. Hebron High School, and hopes to attend a four year university after highschool. 
        The latter half of her summer will consist of her applying to a variety of colleges and hoping she gets in. 
        Emma has a good chance of getting in due to her rigorous schedule and decent grades, but she really needs to improve her SAT scores if she wants to get anywhere.
        Emma loves english and history, but math is only fun to her when she understands it. Because of this, it's not likely she'll major in anything STEM.

        Emma's hobbies include art, playing various sports, and hanging out with friends. She's played soccer for a majority of her life, about 13 or so years.
        She also plays basketball, but has only been playing that for about 9 years. Don't ask her which one she prefers because she doesn't have an answer. 
        Emma has been artisitc for a majority of her life, and you can often find her scribbling and sketching when she's supposed to be doing homework. 
        While art is a huge part of her life, and what she's most passionate about, it's unlikely she'll make it a career. 
        Emma has 3 solid friends, and one of them is her sister. She hangs out with them whenever she can, and probably wouldn't have made it this far without them.
